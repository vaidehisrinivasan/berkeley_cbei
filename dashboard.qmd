    <h2>What are consumption-based emissions?</h2>
    <p>
      Many governments calculate the carbon footprint of a region by measuring emissions generated within distinct geographic boundaries.
      In a globalized economy, however, production and consumption are geographically separated: the goods and services households rely on
      are often produced far from where they are consumed.

    <p>
      A <strong>consumption-based emissions inventory</strong> calculates carbon emissions based on household expenditure patterns,
      regardless of where production occurs. Inspired by the methodology developed by the <a href="https://coolclimate.org/inventory#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley CoolClimate Network</a>, this project explores
      consumption-based emissions across nine ZIP codes in Berkeley, California. <br>
           <br> This project builds a consumption-based emissions inventory (CBEI) for Berkeley using modeled estimates derived from publicly available data. Data sources, assumptions, and modeling choices are documented in a <a href="technical_note/Technical_Note.pdf">Technical Note (PDF)</a>.

Household consumption contributes to carbon emissions through five major categories of spending. @cr-pie_view

The five slices combine 26 individual components, aiming to capture nearly all consumption-based emissions within a city. @cr-pie_view

Some categories reflect direct energy use (especially housing and personal transport), while others reflect "embodied emissions" in supply chains. @cr-pie_view 

Identifying Berkeley's opportunities for reduction requires a closer look at the specific behaviors and infrastructures dominating each category. @cr-pie_view

Transportation is the single largest source of emissions in Berkeley. Despite high rates of EV adoption and a cultural shift toward active commuting, heavy emissions generated by personal cars and long-distance air travel still persist. @cr-highlight_transport

The reliance on personal vehicles is exacerbated by a post-pandemic crisis in public transit. With the Bay Area's regional ridership stagnating, the system faces a looming "fiscal cliff." @cr-highlight_transport

Results suggest that decarbonizing this sector requires a dual approach: sustaining local momentum on active travel and electrification, while stabilizing the regional transit networks necessary to displace high-emission trips. @cr-highlight_transport

Housing is the second biggest contributor of consumption-based emissions in Berkeley. This sector is dominated by the direct combustion of natural gas, with methane-powered water and space heaters ranking as the two largest individual sources of household carbon output. @cr-highlight_housing

Data indicates that older homes frequently generate disproportionately higher emissions, driven by a combination of less efficient thermal insulation and a reliance on outdated appliances. @cr-highlight_housing

Consequently, the path to lowering housing emissions relies heavily on infrastructure upgrades. Replacing legacy gas systems with modern electric heat pumps and improving building envelopes offers the most significant opportunity to decouple home comfort from carbon intensity. @cr-highlight_housing

Food consumption creates nearly 20% of the city's carbon footprint, a figure that exceeds the emissions from all physical goods, such as clothing and furniture, combined. This category captures the full lifecycle of nutrition, combining the often-invisible carbon costs of overlooked factors such as agricultural land use and fertilizer production. @cr-highlight_food

The intensity of these emissions is heavily driven by dietary composition rather than transportation distance. Animal-based products, particularly red meat and dairy, have a disproportionately high carbon footprint due to methane emissions from livestock. As a result, the types of calories consumed often matter more for the climate than where they were grown. @cr-highlight_food

Beyond diet choice, a significant portion of this footprint comes from food that is never consumed. Emissions embedded in spoilage and food waste represent a "double loss": wasting the energy used for production and generating additional methane in landfills. @cr-highlight_food

This category captures the "embodied emissions" of modern life, representing a massive 27.3% share of the total footprint. It aggregates the energy required to mine, manufacture, transport, and sell physical items with the often-overlooked carbon intensity of services, including healthcare, finance, and entertainment. @cr-highlight_goods_services

Emissions from this sector tend to scale linearly with income. In affluent communities like Berkeley, higher purchasing power typically translates into higher consumption volumes, meaning residents are effectively "outsourcing" pollution to the industrial regions where these goods are manufactured. @cr-highlight_goods_services

Because these emissions are baked into the production process before a product even reaches the shelf, reducing this wedge requires a shift in consumer culture. Mitigation strategies focus on the "circular economy": extending the lifespan of products, prioritizing repair over replacement, and shifting spending habits away from material accumulation. @cr-highlight_goods_services

**A City of Contrasts**  
While citywide average shares give us important context, aggregate figures often distort the reality we see on the ground. When we map household emissions by neighborhood, it becomes clear that the overall carbon footprint is not shared equally across Berkeley. Consumption patterns systematically vary, shaping overall emissions.  @cr-map_full

**Lower Emissions Zones**  
In denser neighborhoods like **ZIP 94704** (Downtown/Southside), per-capita emissions drop to around **5,200 kg CO₂e**. Homes in this neighborhood were built in the 1950s or later, and majority of residents walk or bike to work. This neighborhood also uses public transport to reach work more than almost anywhere in the country!  @cr-map_full

**Higher Emissions Zones**  
In contrast, areas like **ZIP 94708** (The Hills) see emissions rise to nearly **24,000 kg CO₂e** per person—more than four times higher. Homes in this neighborhood were primarily built in the 1940s or earlier, having higher operational carbon emissions. Additionally, only 8% of residents opt for public transport to reach their workplace, with majority of the rest driving personal cars or working from home. @cr-map_full

**The Underlying Driver**  
These spatial patterns mirror a deeper economic reality. When we shift our focus from neighborhoods to demographics, a clear correlation emerges between purchasing power and carbon intensity. @cr-map_full

Household carbon footprints rise with median income. While this chart is based on local estimates, this correlation is a well-documented phenomenon across the United States. @cr-income_view 

Financial affluence removes the economic constraints on consumption. With more income, people can "afford" more emissions, buying larger homes, more vehicles, and higher volumes of discretionary goods. @cr-income_view

**Validating the Data**  
Research from the [University of Michigan](https://news.umich.edu/homes-of-wealthy-americans-have-carbon-footprints-25-higher-than-lower-income-residences/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} confirms this pattern, finding that higher-income households in the U.S. have carbon footprints roughly 25% higher than lower-income residences. @cr-income_view

**Anatomy of the Gap**  
To understand why emissions differ among ZIP codes, it is helpful to break down each neighborhoods overall carbon footprint by sector. This chart shows how each ZIP code deviates from the Berkeley average (the center line). Bars to the right emit more than average; bars to the left emit less. @cr-bar_chart_full

**This distribution is lopsided.** A few neighborhoods sit at the extremes, pulling the citywide “average” far up or far down. As a result, average category-wise emissions do not describe a typical neighborhood in Berkeley. In reality, these averages are heavily influenced by outliers. @cr-bar_chart_full

**Two sectors dominate the gap.** The high-emitting ZIPs are not slightly above average across all categories. The biggest departures from average are disproportionately Housing and Transportation. Those segments expand dramatically in the highest-emitting ZIPs relative to others. @cr-bar_chart_full

**Results points to structure, not just virtue.** While individual consumption choices influence a significant proportion of emissions, housing and transportation account for the overwhelming majority. These categories are shaped by Berkeley's built environment: home size and energy systems, street design, transit access, and car dependence. @cr-bar_chart_full

    <h2>From Patterns to Policy</h2>
    
    <p>
      The data reveals that Berkeley's emissions profile is defined by extremes. A handful of wealthy neighborhoods skew the citywide average significantly upward, 
      driven largely by disparities in <strong style="color: #D73027;">Housing</strong> and <strong style="color: #1F78B4;">Transportation</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="thesis-text" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      This suggests that high carbon footprints are not solely a result of personal virtue or individual consumer choices, but also of the <strong>built environment</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Large, older homes and car-dependent infrastructure lock residents into higher emissions, while density and transit access allow others to live 
      low-carbon lifestyles by default.

    <h2>Building a Low-Carbon City</h2>
    <p>
      Closing this gap requires decoupling well-being from high-emitting lifestyles, a goal central to Berkeley's evolving climate strategy. The city’s current roadmap is already advancing specific measures to address these structural inefficiencies, focusing on policy levers that guide sustainable choices and transform the built environment,
